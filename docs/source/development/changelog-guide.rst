Changelog entries
=================

Please add the entries for the changelog under the correct section in ``CHANGELOG.rst``. The sections are ``Features``,
``BugFixes``, with subsections of ``CLI`` and ``API``.

Say I added a new class to ``sloth.raw.complex.tests``, called ``TestFoo``. The changelog entry would be something like:

.. code-block:: rst

    vX.Y.Z
    ------

    Features
    ++++++++

    * Added a new test class (``TestFoo``) to ``sloth.raw.complex.tests``. This class allows you to speedtest your fooing of
      bars.


Which would render as:

vX.Y.Z
^^^^^^
