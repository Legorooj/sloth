Commit guidelines
=================

TL;DR
-----

A commit:

* Stands alone as a single, complete, logical change.
* Has a descriptive commit message
* Has no extraneous modifications - eg fixing a typo in an unrelated file

Avoid committing several unrelated changes in one go.
It makes merging difficult, and also makes it harder to determine which change is the culprit if a bug crops up.

If you did several unrelated changes before committing, ``git gui`` makes committing selected parts and even selected
lines easy. Try the context menu within the window's diff area.

This results in a more readable history, which makes it easier to understand why a change was made - and which changes
caused a bug.


In detail
---------

A commit should be one (and just one) logical unit. If you'd made the following changes:

You can, in fact, view this commit on github: `0d8abc <https://github.com/fluffykoalas/sloth/commit/0d8abc>`_.

Use ``git rebase -i`` to sort, squash, and fix-up commits prior to submitting the pull-request. Make it a readable
history, easy to understand what youâ€™ve done.

Commit messages should provide enough information to enable a third party to decide if the change is relevant to them
and if they need to read the change itself.

Also please set the correct author and email if using ``git`` on the CLI. You can set these like:

    git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

Optionally remove the ``--global`` flag to set them for just that repo.
