Development
===========

Seeing as ``sloth`` is an open source project, contributions are welcome! This allows us to provide features that the
community want to be included.

If you've found a bug, or would like to request a feature, please submit it on our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/fluffykoalas/issues>`_ on GitHub.
