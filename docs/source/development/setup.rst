Setting up a local development environment
==========================================

First of all, make sure you've forked the repository on GitHub.

1. ``git clone https://github.com/<your-account-here>/sloth.git``

2. Navigate into the directory with ``cd sloth``, then install the package with `pip install -e .`.

3. Install the testing dependencies with ``pip install -r requirements-test.txt``.

4. DEVELOP! Please remember that any changes to entry-points will require you to re-run ``pip install -e .``
