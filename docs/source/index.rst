``sloth\docs``
==============

``sloth`` is a Python package for speedtesting python code and functions with as little code as necessary.
It's easy to use and, unlike many projects, has decent documentation.

The idea behind this API is to allow easy speedtesting of code. It aims to have all of the features which the ``timeit``
module does - and many more - behind an easier interface.


Installation
------------

You can install sloth with pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install sloth-speedtest

Please see :doc:`Installation <installation>` for more information.
